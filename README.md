# Welcome to My Notes

-   These were created using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).
-   And created with the intention of making my dev notes easily accessible for "ME".
-   Having them hosted on a public server is just a happy co-incidence.

## Organisation

-   On a high level, each different coding tool has a seperate folder.
-   All folders will have a sub-sections and so on.
-   This is all done for my benefit and understanding and not to make the site easily readable.

## Free-to-use

-   You are free to use any code snippet from here for your own benefit, without attributing any credit to me.

## Public

-   Since this is hosted on github pages, this is a public repo. There is no other reason.
-   I was not interested in creating a open source project.
-   I am not inclined to maintain this repo for anyone else's benefit other than mine. So please do not create any issues or request any features.
