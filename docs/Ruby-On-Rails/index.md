# My Ruby on rails Notes

## Introduction
- These are my ruby on rails code/notes.

## My Coding Journey
- I started with Ruby on rails in early 2019, I suppose.
- I bought a course on udemy and that was the start. 
- Learning to code was always a deep desire for me but at the same time very daunting.
- Where do you start, what language to pick up. 
- A friend suggest RoR and I've been with it ever since. It is not a bad place for begineers to start.
