# My Gatsby Notes

- I use gatsby to create static sites and landing pages.
- I just stumbled on this SSG, there are obviously hundreds if not thousand options available. 
- I found it more customisable than jekyll and that is why I have probably used it more extensively than jekyll
- I use it to create all my landing pages. 
- Although I must say the only thing I hate about gatsby is the time it takes to generate a new build. In comparison, jekyll or mkdocs are almost instantaneous.
